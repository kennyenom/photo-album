            jey and i We had a mutual friend who introduced us, and we became really close  friends at first, which then led to a romantic relationship. We were long-distance, which made us work for our relationship.
            I would say it’s been like a fairy tale in a way, since every time I saw her in person I’d get butterflies and we’d try to make the time together as memorable as we could.
            "Our relationship has always been based on trust and honesty.we were so devoted to each other and each other’s happiness. Simple things made our day: a small message,
            "We work well together as a team, and the love we have for each other helps us grow together. We support each other, understand each other, encourage each other. We make sure that we make time for each other, whether it’s 15 to 20 minutes of catching up on life’s happenings, or enjoying a date night at home .
